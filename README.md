### What is Php-pastebin? ###

> Pastebin is here to help you collaborate on debugging code snippets. 
>If you're not familiar with the idea, most people use it like this: submit a code fragment to pastebin, getting a url like http://demo.php-pastebin.com/DSNnglex, paste the url into an IRC or IM conversation, someone responds by reading and perhaps submitting a modification of your code, you then view the modification, maybe using the built in diff tool to help locate the changes
