### What is Php-pastebin? ###

> Pastebin is here to help you collaborate on debugging code snippets.  
> If you're not familiar with the idea, most people use it like this:  

*   Submit a code fragment to Php-pastebin,  
*   Getting a url like http://demo.php-pastebin.com/DSNnglex,
*   paste the url into an IRC or IM conversation, someone responds by reading and perhaps submitting a modification of your code, you then view the modification, maybe using the built in diff tool to help locate the changes
